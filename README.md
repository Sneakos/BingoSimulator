Simulate Bingo Cards when you are really bored...

This was a "I'm really bored, let's create something random" type of program. You either randomly generate or manually generate a bingo card, and it simulates a game of bingo to determine which of the three cards won.

I designed this for linux (it colors the cards), and I'm not sure the escape characters will work on other platforms
